## 'ello!

I'm Jonathan, just a random guy who spends way to much time programming computers to do interesting stuff. Some of the things that currently interest me are Linux, creating a website, automating my Mac, doing funny stuff with Python and shell scripting, and the Bitcoin ecosystem. Outside of the digital universe I enjoy playing tennis and travelling.

If you would like to reach out for any reason just shoot me an email at my address on my GitHub profile.

And yes, in case you were wondering, my username is indeed from an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/378/) and I do actually use (Neo)Vim. My profile pic is also generated by DALL - E 2, because why not.
