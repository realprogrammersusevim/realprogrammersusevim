I'm Jonathan, a random guy who spends way to much time programming computers to
do interesting stuff. Some of the things that currently interest me are NeoVim,
automating my Mac, doing funny stuff with Python and shell scripting, Rust, and
the Bitcoin ecosystem. Outside of the digital universe I enjoy playing tennis
and travelling.
